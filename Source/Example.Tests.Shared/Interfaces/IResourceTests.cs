/// <para>
/// In Pulumiâ€™s default testing framework, mocking resources requires implementing <see cref="IMocks"/> 
/// and overriding <c>NewResourceAsync</c>. To mock a resource, you must match its type using its fully 
/// qualified schema token (e.g., <c>azure-native:keyvault:Vault</c>), which often requires inspecting 
/// source code or documentation. You then construct output dictionaries manually and carefully merge them 
/// with inputs to reflect Pulumi's behavior where some inputs are mirrored in outputs. If you want to target 
/// specific resources by logical name, you also need additional conditionals to match <c>args.Name</c>.
/// </para>

/// <para>
/// <c>Pulumock</c> simplifies this process with fluent APIs such as <c>WithMockResource</c> and 
/// <c>WithoutMockResource</c>, allowing developers to add or remove mocks for specific resource types or 
/// even specific named instances. Instead of dealing with stringly-typed dictionaries, you can use 
/// <c>MockResourceBuilder</c> and chain <c>WithOutput</c> calls using strongly-typed expressions.
/// </para>

/// Additionally, Pulumock enhances test observability by exposing <c>EnrichedResource</c> objects, 
/// which include not just resolved outputs, but also the raw inputs passed to the resources.
